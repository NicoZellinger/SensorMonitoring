# setup dev environment
- Download and install STM32CubeMX
- Download and install System Workbench from openstm32

Create Project in STM32CubeMX.  
Select SW4STM32 as Toolchain/IDE in CubeMX Settings.  
Consider using FreeRTOS because its really cool :P  

After creating project and generating source, open it
in System Workbench. Should run out of the box.

By the way: System Workbench is available for Linux too.
