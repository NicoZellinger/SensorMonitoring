# setup dev environment
Download and install System Workbench from [openstm32](http://www.openstm32.org/HomePage)

or:  
Integrate System Workbench in your existing Eclipse. Read on the [openstm32](http://www.openstm32.org/HomePage)
website how to do this.


Open System Workbench or Eclipse and create a workspace or use your existing.

Close this git repo to your harddrive somewhere (must not be inside the workspace).

Click *File* > *Import* > *Existing Project into Workspace*  
Browse to the git repo and select *firmware/fw_v1* folder.

Uncheck *Copy projects into workspace* and click *Finish*.  
Now you have your project in the project explorer and can work with it
and sync your changes to git.

Click the green play/run button to flash the software. Debug also works.

Have fun!
